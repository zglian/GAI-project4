# Project Overview

This project contains three Jupyter notebooks:

1. `project4-ddpm.ipynb`: This notebook contains the implementation of DDPM alone.
2. `project4-dip.ipynb`: This notebook contains the implementation of DIP alone.
3. `project4-combined.ipynb`: This notebook combines DIP and DDPM, using DIP to accelerate DDPM.

## Running the Notebooks

These notebooks are designed to be run on Kaggle. Follow the steps below to run the notebooks:

1. **Create a New Kaggle Notebook**:
   - Click on the "Notebooks" tab on Kaggle.
   - Select "New Notebook" to create a new notebook environment.

2. **Upload the Project Files**:
   - Upload the three Jupyter notebooks (`project4-ddpm.ipynb`, `project4-dip.ipynb`, and `project4-combined.ipynb`) to your new Kaggle notebook.
   - To upload, click on the "Add Data" button on the right panel, then click "Upload" and select the files from your local machine.

3. **Run the Notebooks**:
   - Open each notebook in the order listed above.
   - Run the cells sequentially to ensure that each step of the implementation is executed properly.
